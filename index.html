            <h2>Skills & Expertise</h2>
            <p>
                Experienced in the observation and recreation of complex natural behaviors, my primary interest lies in gaining a profound and foundational understanding of how systems work. This expertise fuels my teaching and programming practice, where I guide students in graphics programming, shading, and more.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have a strong background in the day-to-day use of programming languages such as **C#**, **HLSL**, and **GLSL**, alongside multiple node-based interfaces. I am actively refreshing my **C++** skills while also working with **OpenGL** and **DirectX** to further deepen my understanding.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have a vast experience using a variety of 3D software and engines, and practical experience with the **Adobe Suite**. Currently, I am developing my own Render Engine for educational purposes.
            </p>

                    <p>
                        Developed a Lava Lamp Configurator using Unreal Engine. The project features technical implementations in ray marching, shading, and blueprint-driven dynamic configuration.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Key Highlights:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>- Implemented multiple HLSL files for ray marching, simulating volumes, depths, and interactions between waxes and liquids.</li>
                        <li>- Utilized Unreal Engine’s Material Editor to create PBR volume materials from ray marching data.</li>
                        <li>- Developed a blueprint-driven configurator that links physical attributes like size, lighting, and temperature using hash maps.</li>
                        <li>- Use substrate materials for a more accurate shading model.</li>

                    <h3>Wave Function Collapse Algorithm</h3>
                    <p>
                        Designed a 2D Wave Function Collapse Algorithm in C#. This project extends my understanding of data management and algorithms, using functional programming and quantum mechanics.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The algorithm procedurally generates configurations of modules within a grid, allowing for endless combinations. I am currently working on converting this into a 3D version for artists to use in constructing procedural buildings and environments.
